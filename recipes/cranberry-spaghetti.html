    <p>This dish provides a sweet-tart kick from jellied cranberry sauce that you wouldn't expect to be good but somehow is combined with jarred sauce for a quick shake up meal you should try now. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 pound mild country sausage</li>
        <li>1 1/2 (12 ounces)jars mushroom spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 (14 ounces) can jellied cranberry sauce</li>

        <li>1/2 (15 ounce) container ricotta</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces finely shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

      <p><h6>Step 1</h6></p><p>Cook and stir ground beef and sausage in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, breaking up chunks with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 7 minutes. Strain the grease and return meat to the pot.</p>

      <p><h6>Step 4</h6></p><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.</p>

      <p><h6>Step 5</h6></p><p>Combine ricotta and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl and set aside.</p>

      <p><h6>Step 6</h6></p><p>Serve meat sauce over angel hair pasta and top with a dollop of ricotta mixture. Serve immediately.</p>
