    <p>This dish provides a sweet-tart kick from jellied cranberry sauce that you wouldn't expect to be good but somehow is when combined with jarred sauce for a quick shake up meal you should try now. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 pound mild country sausage</li>
        <li>1 1/2 (12 ounces)jars mushroom spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 (14 ounces) can jellied cranberry sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 (15 ounce) container ricotta</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces finely shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef and sausage in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, breaking up chunks with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 7 minutes. Strain the grease and return meat to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add 3 jars spaghetti sauce to the pot and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mash cranberry sauce with a fork and add to meat sauce. Continue cooking for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Serve meat sauce over angel hair pasta and top with a dollop of ricotta mixture. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
